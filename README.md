How Data Flows into MovieModal

User clicks a movie card
setShowModal(true) opens modal.
MovieModal movie={movie} passes the movie object.

MovieModal receives movie
Uses movie.id to fetch trailer.
Stores the trailer key in state.

UI updates
If trailer found â†’ plays inside <iframe>.
If not found â†’ shows "No Trailer Available ðŸ˜”".

Close button
Calls onClose (from parent MovieCard) â†’ hides modal.

ðŸ‘‰ So MovieModal is like a popup player that depends on:
movie (data passed from MovieCard)
onClose (function passed from MovieCard)


Where props are passed
To Banner
<Banner movie={NowPlaying[Math.floor(Math.random() * NowPlaying.length)]} />
ðŸ‘‰ You are sending 1 random movie object from NowPlaying.

Inside Banner.js, you receive it like this:
const Banner = ({ movie }) => { ... }


To MovieRow
<MovieRow title="Now Playing" movies={NowPlaying} />

ðŸ‘‰ You are sending two props:
title â†’ string ("Now Playing")
movies â†’ array of movies (NowPlaying)

Inside MovieRow.js, you receive it like this:
const MovieRow = ({ title, movies }) => { ... }


Inside MovieRow â†’ To MovieCard
{movies?.map((movie) => (
  <MovieCard key={movie.id} movie={movie} />
))}


ðŸ‘‰ Each movie object is passed as movie prop to MovieCard.

Inside MovieCard â†’ To MovieModal (on click)
{showModal && (
  <MovieModal movie={movie} onClose={() => setShowModal(false)} />
)}
ðŸ‘‰ When clicked, that same movie object is passed into MovieModal.


âœ… So, all data is passed down from Browse.js â†’ Banner / MovieRow â†’ MovieCard â†’ MovieModal.
The source of truth is Redux (useSelector).
